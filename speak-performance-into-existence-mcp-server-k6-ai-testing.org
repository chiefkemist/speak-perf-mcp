#+title ðŸš€ Speak Performance into Existence: AI-Driven Application Testing with k6


* About performance testing
Performance testing evaluates how a system behaves under load, ensuring reliability, scalability, and responsiveness. It helps identify bottlenecks before they impact users.

** Key Definitions
- *Load Testing*: Simulates expected user traffic.
- *Stress Testing*: Pushes system beyond limits to find breaking points.
- *Spike Testing*: Sudden increases in load.
- *Endurance Testing*: Prolonged load to check stability.

** Why It Matters
- Prevents outages
- Improves user experience
- Reduces costs by early detection

* Overview of k6 including scripting
k6 is an open-source load testing tool for testing the performance of APIs, microservices, and websites. It uses JavaScript for scripting.

** k6 Features
- Modern scripting (ES6 JS)
- CLI and cloud execution
- Metrics and thresholds

** Example k6 Script
#+begin_src javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';
export default function () {
  let res = http.get('https://test.k6.io');
  check(res, { 'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });
}
#+end_src

* Manual execution of k6 scripts
Run scripts locally using the CLI:
#+begin_src shell
k6 run script.js
#+end_src

** Output
- Real-time metrics in terminal
- Optionally export to JSON, InfluxDB, etc.

* Step 0: Wrapping K6 in MCP over stdio
Integrate k6 with a Machine Control Protocol (MCP) interface using standard input/output for automation.

** Narrative
- MCP acts as a controller, sending commands to k6 and parsing results.
- Enables scripting and orchestration from other tools.

  MCP->>k6: Stop/Query status
#+end_src

* Step 1: Make the setup portable still over stdio and expose resources
Package the solution (e.g., Docker) for portability. Expose logs, metrics, and artifacts via well-defined resources.

** Narrative
- Use containers for consistent environments.
- Expose endpoints for logs and results.

* Step 2: Move setup to remote with SSE/streaming HTTP
Transition to a remote architecture using Server-Sent Events (SSE) or streaming HTTP for real-time updates.

** Narrative
- Decouple test runner and controller.
- Stream results to dashboards or CI/CD systems.
