# Step 1 Implementation Details

## Key Changes from Original Design

### 1. Compose File Handling
- **Accepts URLs or file paths** - Can download from GitHub, GitLab, etc.
- **Stores complete content in SQLite** - No filesystem dependencies
- **Generates unique temp directories** - Avoids collisions
- **Hash-based deduplication** - Reuses identical compose files

### 2. Session-Based Architecture
```
compose_files -> test_sessions -> services/tests/specs
```
- Each test run has a unique session
- All resources tied to sessions for easy cleanup
- Complete audit trail in database

### 3. Container Lifecycle
- **Never leaves containers running** - Always cleans up
- **Unique project names** - Prevents conflicts
- **Temp directory isolation** - Each run in separate directory
- **Automatic cleanup on errors** - Uses defer statements

### 4. Two Usage Patterns

#### Pattern A: Automated (One Command)
```
test_application:
  - Input: compose source URL/path
  - Output: Complete test report
  - Zero manual steps
```

#### Pattern B: Quick Test (Custom Parameters)
```
quick_performance_test:
  - Input: compose source + VUs + duration
  - Output: Focused performance results
  - Simplified flow
```

## Database Schema

### compose_files
- Stores actual Docker Compose content
- Tracks source URL/path
- MD5 hash for deduplication

### test_sessions
- Groups related operations
- Tracks lifecycle (initialized -> running -> completed)
- Links to compose file

### services
- Extracted from compose file
- Stored per session
- Used for port discovery

## Security Considerations

1. **Temp file cleanup** - Always removes temp directories
2. **Container cleanup** - Always stops and removes containers
3. **No local file assumptions** - Works in any environment
4. **Isolated execution** - Each test in separate namespace

## Example Flows

### URL-based Testing
```
1. User: "Test application at https://example.com/compose.yml"
2. MCP: Downloads compose file
3. MCP: Stores in SQLite with hash
4. MCP: Creates temp directory
5. MCP: Writes compose to temp
6. MCP: Starts containers with unique project name
7. MCP: Discovers APIs
8. MCP: Runs tests
9. MCP: Stops containers
10. MCP: Removes temp directory
11. MCP: Returns comprehensive report
```

### Local File Testing
```
1. User: "Quick test on ./my-app/docker-compose.yml"
2. MCP: Reads local file
3. MCP: Same flow as URL-based
```

## Error Handling

- Invalid compose files caught early
- Failed container starts reported clearly
- Cleanup always happens (defer statements)
- Session status tracked in database

## Future Enhancements

1. **Service targeting** - Test specific services only
2. **Advanced API parsing** - Extract SLAs from OpenAPI
3. **Custom test patterns** - User-defined scenarios
4. **Parallel testing** - Multiple services simultaneously
5. **Result comparison** - Automatic regression detection
